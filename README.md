# Student Organizer
Brief Description:
Our project is a grade/classes organizer that is directed toward student audiences.  It has features such as:
(1) todo list
(2) grade calculator
(3) schedule

Group members: Mikayla Mancini, Brooke Felsheim, and Amy Kim

# Iteration 1:
User stories completed this iteration:
- A student should be able to make a to-do list of their current homework assignments so that they can better organize their time.
- A student should be able to view their current class roster so they can keep track of all of their current classes.
- A student should be able to add a new task to the to-do list so that they can keep track of new assignments.
- A student should be able to delete a class from their roster so they can update what classes they are in.
- A student should be able to delete a task from the to-do list in case that task no longer needs to be completed.
- A student should be able to add a new class to their class roster so that they can keep track of what classes they are in.
- A student should be able to interact with the student organizer via a GUI so it is easier to use.

User stories to be completed next iteration:
- A student should be able to delete and edit a grade and its type so that they can keep an accurate record of their grades.
- A student should be able to mark a task in the to-do list as completed so that they know it is done.
- A student should be able to access their schedule for any given day so that they can plan out their day.
- A student should be able to mark a task in the todo-list as urgent so that they can prioritize it.
- A student should be able to add what time a class meets to their schedule so that they know when to attend class.

Implemented features that don't currently work:
- The schedule pages are accessible from the home page, but no class schedules can be added yet.
- The grade page is accessible from the home page, but the "add class with grade information" and "enter grades for class" buttons are not yet working.
- The "mark as urgent" and "mark as completed" buttons are not yet working on the modify tasks to-do list page.

# Iteration 2:
User stories completed this iteration:
- A student should be able to run the student organizer from a single .sh script on the command line so they can easily run the application.
- A student should be able to enter a grade that they received in a class and its type so that they can keep track of their final grade.
- A student should be able to specify the weight breakdown of a class so that the grade calculator can calculate grades with regard to weights.
- A student should be able to mark a task in the todo-list as completed so that they know it is done.
- A student should be able to mark a task in the todo-list as urgent so that they can prioritize it.
- A student should be able to access their schedule for any given day so that they can plan out their day.
- A student should be able to add what time a class meets to their schedule so that they know when to attend class.

User stories to be completed next iteration:
- A student should be able to edit or delete what time a class meets to their schedule so that if there are any changes they will still go to class on time.
- A student should be able to view a sorted to-do list, where urgent and uncompleted tasks sit at the top of the to-do list, so they can get a better idea of what needs to be accomplished first.
- A student should be able to delete and edit a grade and its type so that they can keep an accurate record of their grades.
- A student should be able to delete all completed tasks in the to-do list at once so they can de-clutter their list when needed.
- A student should be able to view their current grade for any given class based on the assignments they uploaded (real and hypothetical) so that they can track their current standing.
- A student should be able to view a hypothetical final grade with regards to hypothetical grades they entered so that they can determine how well they need to do on a task.
- A student should be able to change the weight breakdown of a class in case the syllabus changes so that their grade accurately reflects the current weight breakdown.

Implemented features that don't currently work:
- All implemented user interface functions should work.

# Iteration 3:
User stories completed this iteration:
- A student should be able to delete a grade so that they can keep an accurate record of their grades.
- A student should be able to view their current grade for any given class based on the assignments they uploaded so that they can track their current standing.
- A student should be able to edit the name of an event in their schedule in case they made an error in initially naming it.
- A student should be able to delete an event from their schedule in case this event is no longer occuring.
- A student should be able to edit what time a class meets to their schedule so that if there are any changes they will still go to class on time.
- A student should be able to delete all completed tasks in the to-do list at once so they can de-clutter their list when needed.
- A student should be able to mark all tasks as completed in the to-do list at once so they can update their list efficiently when needed.
- A student should be able to mark all tasks as completed in the to-do list at once so they can update their list efficiently when needed.

Implemented features that don't currently work:
- All implemented user interface functions should work.

# Commands needed to compile and run our code:
For a Mac via command line:
1. Navigate to the "project-mancini-felsheim-kim-237project" folder. If you type "ls" here, you should see the file "runStudentOrganizer.sh"
2. Run the command "sh runStudentOrganizer.sh"

From Eclipse:
1. Navigate to project-mancini-felsheim-kim-237project > src > studentOrganizer > OrganizerHomePage.java
2. Run OrganizerHomePage
