# Student Organizer
Brief Description:
Our project is a grade/classes organizer that is directed toward student audiences.  It has features such as:
(1) todo list
(2) grade calculator
(3) schedule

Group members: Mikayla Mancini, Brooke Felsheim, and Amy Kim

# Iteration 1:
User stories completed this iteration:
- A student should be able to make a to-do list of their current homework assignments so that they can better organize their time.
- A student should be able to view their current class roster so they can keep track of all of their current classes.
- A student should be able to add a new task to the to-do list so that they can keep track of new assignments.
- A student should be able to delete a class from their roster so they can update what classes they are in.
- A student should be able to delete a task from the to-do list in case that task no longer needs to be completed.
- A student should be able to add a new class to their class roster so that they can keep track of what classes they are in.
- A student should be able to interact with the student organizer via a GUI so it is easier to use.

User stories to be completed next iteration:
- A student should be able to delete and edit a grade and its type so that they can keep an accurate record of their grades.
- A student should be able to mark a task in the to-do list as completed so that they know it is done.
- A student should be able to access their schedule for any given day so that they can plan out their day.
- A student should be able to mark a task in the todo-list as urgent so that they can prioritize it.
- A student should be able to add what time a class meets to their schedule so that they know when to attend class.

Implemented features that don't currently work:
- The schedule pages are accessible from the home page, but no class schedules can be added yet.
- The grade page is accessible from the home page, but the "add class with grade information" and "enter grades for class" buttons are not yet working.
- The "mark as urgent" and "mark as completed" buttons are not yet working on the modify tasks to-do list page.
- Hint: sometimes you have to click a button twice for it to work!
